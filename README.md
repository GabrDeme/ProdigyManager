# ProdigyManager

ProdigyManager is a comprehensive product management system designed to solidify key programming concepts through hands-on development. This project focuses on utilizing object-oriented programming (OOP) best practices, guiding students through the creation of a functional and scalable application.

## Overview

At the heart of ProdigyManager is the ability to manage entities like brands, users, and products efficiently. The `Login` class serves as the core of the application, responsible for generating menus and handling all the primary functionalities. By invoking the `Login` constructor in `program.cs`, users can navigate through the entire application.

### Objectives

- Strengthen understanding of OOP principles.
- Build a functional product management system following development best practices.
- Improve skills in organizing C# projects.

### Features

- **Brand Management:** Add, modify, and delete product brands.
- **User Management:** Manage user profiles and information.
- **Product Management:** Create and update product listings.
- **Login System:** Centralized authentication, handling navigation through program features.

### Functional Flow

1. **Create Project Structure:** Lay the foundation with files and folders.
2. **Develop Core Classes:** Implement the key classesâ€”`Brand`, `User`, `Product`, and `Login`.
3. **Implement Logic:** Build methods to handle various operations and user interactions.
4. **Generate Menus and Options:** The `Login` class displays and navigates program options, acting as the primary access point from `program.cs`.

## Technologies

- **Back-end:** C#
